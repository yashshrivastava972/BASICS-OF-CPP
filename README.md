                                                                     PROGRAM 1A:

Aim: Hello World Program.

Tool: VS CODE.

Theory: The "Hello World" program is the simplest C++ program used to understand the basic structure and syntax of C++.

Purpose:
To display the message "Hello World" on the screen.

Key Components:
1. #include <iostream>
Includes the input-output stream library for using cout.
2. using namespace std;
Allows direct use of standard library functions like cout without writing std::cout.
3. int main()
Entry point of the program where execution starts.
4. cout << "Hello World";
Prints the text "Hello World" to the screen.
5. return 0;
Ends the program and returns control to the operating system, indicating successful execution.

Conclusion: The "Hello World" program demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program, including header files, namespaces, main function, and output statement. It is the first step for learning how C++ works and is commonly used as an introductory example in programming.

Aim: Calculator Program.

Tool: VS CODE.

Theory: A calculator program in C++ is used to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

Key Features:
User Input:
The program takes two numbers (operands) from the user.
It also takes an operator (+, -, *, /) to decide which operation to perform.

Decision-Making (if or switch):
The program uses a switch-case or if-else structure to choose the correct operation based on the input operator.

Operations Performed:

Addition: num1 + num2
Subtraction: num1 - num2
Multiplication: num1 * num2
Division: num1 / num2 (includes check for divide by zero)

Output:
The result of the chosen operation is displayed using cout.

Purpose:
Helps beginners understand arithmetic operators, input/output, and control structures like switch or if-else.

Conclusion:
The calculator program is a basic yet powerful way to learn fundamental C++ concepts such as variables, operators, user input/output, and decision-making. It lays the groundwork for more advanced programming logic and real-world applications.
