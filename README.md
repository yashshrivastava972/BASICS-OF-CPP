Aim: Hello World Program.

Tool: VS CODE.

Theory: The "Hello World" program is the simplest C++ program used to understand the basic structure and syntax of C++.

Purpose:
To display the message "Hello World" on the screen.

Key Components:
1. #include <iostream>
Includes the input-output stream library for using cout.
2. using namespace std;
Allows direct use of standard library functions like cout without writing std::cout.
3. int main()
Entry point of the program where execution starts.
4. cout << "Hello World";
Prints the text "Hello World" to the screen.
5. return 0;
Ends the program and returns control to the operating system, indicating successful execution.

Conclusion: The "Hello World" program demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program, including header files, namespaces, main function, and output statement. It is the first step for learning how C++ works and is commonly used as an introductory example in programming.
